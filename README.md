# 📌 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

### 📖 Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing **Requirement Analysis** in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It contains detailed explanations, examples, and practical insights into the foundational phase that determines the success of any software project.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase** in the SDLC that involves the systematic process of **gathering, documenting, analyzing, and validating** the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  

It serves as the **bridge between business needs and technical implementation**.  

During this phase, business analysts, developers, and stakeholders work together to:  
- ✅ Identify what the system should do (*functional requirements*)  
- ⚙️ Determine how well the system should perform (*non-functional requirements*)  
- 🛑 Establish clear boundaries and constraints for the project  
- 🤝 Create a shared understanding among all project participants  

> Requirement Analysis is the foundation upon which all subsequent development activities are built. It ensures the final product meets user expectations and business objectives while minimizing costly changes later.  

---

## 🌟 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a pivotal role in project success for several critical reasons:  

1. 💰 **Reduces Development Costs and Time**  
   Identifying and resolving requirement issues early is far cheaper than fixing them later.  
   - Fixing a defect in requirements = 1x cost  
   - Fixing the same defect in maintenance = 100x cost  

2. 🤝 **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment**  
   Clear documentation creates a shared understanding among developers, clients, and managers. This prevents miscommunication, reduces scope creep, and keeps everyone aligned.  

3. 🎯 **Provides Clear Project Scope and Direction**  
   Well-defined requirements establish project boundaries, prevent feature bloat, and ensure resources are used efficiently.

## 📂 Types of Requirements

### 🔹 Functional Requirements
Define *what the system should do* — the specific behaviors, functions, and features.  

**Examples (Booking Management System):**
- Users must be able to search for available properties by location, date, and number of guests  
- The system shall allow users to create and manage accounts  
- Users must be able to make, modify, and cancel bookings  
- Automated confirmation emails upon booking  
- Property owners can list properties with details and pricing  
- Secure payment processing through gateways  
- Users can leave reviews and ratings  

---

### 🔹 Non-functional Requirements
Define *how the system should perform* — quality attributes, constraints, and operational criteria.  

**Examples (Booking Management System):**
- ⚡ **Performance:** Search results must load within 3 seconds  
- 📈 **Scalability:** Support up to 10,000 concurrent users  
- 🔒 **Security:** Encrypt all user data with AES-256  
- 🌍 **Availability:** Maintain 99.9% uptime  
- 🎨 **Usability:** Booking process completable within 5 clicks  
- 🖥️ **Compatibility:** Work on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge + mobile  
- 🔁 **Reliability:** MTBF ≥ 720 hours

## 🎭 Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams illustrate **functional requirements** by showing interactions between users (*actors*) and the system.  

**Benefits:**
- 📊 Simplify complex systems  
- 🗣️ Improve communication with stakeholders  
- 🚧 Identify system boundaries  
- 💻 Guide development teams  
- 🧪 Support test case creation  

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are **measurable conditions** that must be met for a feature to be accepted. They define *“Done”* and ensure clarity between stakeholders and developers.  

**Importance:**
- 🎯 Clear definition of done  
- 🛡️ Quality assurance  
- 🧪 Testing foundation  
- 🚫 Prevents scope creep  
- 📢 Communication tool
